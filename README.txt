## 🚀 About Me

With over 5 years of full-stack experience, I craft intuitive, scalable web applications from pixel-perfect interfaces to robust APIs.  
My stack blends creativity with precision—React, Angular, Storybook, Node.js, Python, and a whole lot of empathy.

Whether it's turning complex datasets into stories, building modular design systems, or deploying AI that thinks differently—  
**with me, you don’t just build apps—you build smart experiences.**
